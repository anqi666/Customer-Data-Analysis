# Kaggle Project: Sales Prediction of Time-series Data

This is final project for a Coursera course on machine learning hosted on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-final-project). In this competition, a time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data is provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company.

The dataset consists of daily historical sales data of over 22k items across 60 shops for periods from January 2013 to October 2015. The goal is to predict the number of items sold for each of the item and shop combination for November 2015. There are 2.9 million rows of data in the training set and 214k rows in the test set.

The repository includes 7 Jupyter Notebooks:

- Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Part 2: Feature Engineering
- Part 3: Scaling and defining a validation plan
- Part 4.1: Linear regression
- Part 4.2: Light GBM
- Part 4.3: Neural Network
- Part 5: Ensemble<br>

The notebooks describe the thought process and steps taken to achieve the goal.

The main libraries utilized include Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Keras with TensorFlow backend, and Seaborn.
